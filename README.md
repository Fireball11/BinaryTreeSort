# BinaryTreeSort
Its my trying to create a binary tree sort on JS. 

## First try
Tree was made, but i cant solve how to take variables  

## Second try
Tree was made by using Object variables.
Root variable:
Object = {
  value: 4 // or any other integer
  right: "Object with 'Object.value' bigger then this.value"
  left: "Object with 'Object.value' lower then this.value"lower
}
